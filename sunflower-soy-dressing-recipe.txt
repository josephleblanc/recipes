Prep Time: 5 minutes
Cook Time: N/A
Yields: 8 cups

Ingredients:

    1 1/2 cups sunflower seeds
    1 cup apple cider vinegar
    1 cup soy sauce
    3 cups canola oil (non-GMO)
    1 cup cold water + 1 after blending

 Instructions:

    -Combine all (except last cup of water).
    -Run in blender (Vitamix works best) until there are no traces of
    seeds, but don't over blend as it will get syrup-y.
    -Pour into container and whisk in the last cup of water.

For gluten-free option try substituting the soy sauce with tamari sauce
and/or Bragg's aminos. If you're not into canola oil then go with
another type of gentle flavor oil. Olive oil is probably not the most
ideal for this dressing.
